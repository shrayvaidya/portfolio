          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a rising fourth year student at
            <strong>Northwestern University</strong> studying
            <strong>Computer Science</strong> with minors in
            <strong>Data Science</strong>, <strong>Classical Studies</strong>, and
            <strong>South Asian Humanities</strong>. In my free time, I like to
            read, play videogames, work out, and try out new recipes. Outside of academics,
            I am also the Director of Technology for Northwestern Model United Nations and 
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am working as a <strong>Data Science Intern</strong> for the fintech start up  <strong>Neon Financial Inc</strong> based in Chicago. In this role, I have been personally responsible for writing complex Python scripts to 
            parse and compute metrics from Experian credit files. I have also worked directly on analyzing large datasets to predict the best areas for company growth and measure current business efficiency and customer turnover. My other 
            professional experience includes two summers interning at the cybersecurity firm <strong>IronSDN Corp</strong>., where I worked as a <strong>Software Development/Data Science Intern</strong>. 
            In this role, I worked directly on training and testing AI-based systems to detect the breaking of glass as well as facial recognition. Other projects were focused on web development,
            where I applied my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript (React) to build sites to train clients on common phishing tactics. I also collected and analyzed over 500,000 
            data points from client systems on their readiness to defend against cyber threats using SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn) and built a visualization dashboard
            with Tableau. Outside of these internships, I have also worked part time at <strong>Northwestern McCormick IT</strong> as a <strong>Computer Aide</strong>, where I was responsible for maintaining several computer labs
            and troubleshooting various software and hardware issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am seeking <strong>full time roles starting in August 2024</strong> in Software Development, Data Analytics/Engineering, and Business Analytics.
            Please reach out if interested!

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a third year student at
            <strong>Northwestern University</strong> studying
            <strong>Computer Science</strong> with minors in
            <strong>Data Science</strong>, <strong>Classics</strong>, and
            <strong>South Asian Humanities</strong>. In my free time, I like to
            read, play videogames, work out, and try out new recipes. Outside of academics,
            I am also the Treasurer for the South Asian Students Alliance as well ac the C40
            Committee Chair for Northwestern Model United Nations.
          </p>
          <p>
            My professional experience includes two summers interning at the cybersecurity firm <strong>IronSDN Corp</strong>., where I worked as a <strong>Software Development/Data Science Intern</strong>. 
            In this role, I worked directly on training and testing AI-based systems to detect the breaking of glass as well as facial recognition. Other projects were focused on web development,
            where I applied my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript (React) to build sites to train clients on common phishing tactics. I collected and analyzed over 500,000 
            data points from client systems on their readiness to defend against cyber threats using SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn) and built a visualization dashboard
            with Tableau. Outside of these internships, I also work part time at <strong>Northwestern McCormick IT</strong> as a <strong>Computer Aide</strong>, where I am responsible for maintaining several computer labs
            and troubleshooting various software and hardware issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am seeking <strong>internships for Summer 2023</strong> in Software Engineering, Data Analytics, Data Engineering, AI/Machine Learning, and other technology-related fields.
            Please reach out if interested!

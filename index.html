                    Cor.io is an experimental choreography assistant powered by the OpenAI API. 
                    With this tool, choreographers can find songs, formations, and costumes for their next performance in a few simple steps.
                    Check out this short demo video to see how it works.

                  <p>
                    Using R, I analyzed an open-source dataset on hundreds of Bollywood musicians, 
                    directors, and actors to see how the average budget and revenue of their movies
                    varied based on several factors (such as the movie's release period, whether it
                    was part of a franchise, etc). I then used Shiny to build a dashboard to create bar 
                    and pie plots to visualize these statistics and distributions. The project is viewable

                    A model of a photo-sharing social media built with HTML,
                    CSS, Javascript in REST architectural style. Utilizes several
                    web development and database tools, including Node.js, React,
                    Flask, and PostgreSQL. A custom API to fetch and post user data, post data,
                    and comment data was also built. This project was made as 
                    a part of the curriculum for CS 396: Intro to Web Development.

                <p>
                  As part of my data science coursework, I have built and compiled reports on different statistical models; currently, 
                  I am working on a classification model using decision trees and random forests to predict whether a given player will be 
                  an NBA All-Star based on their statistics from the regular season. Previously, I built models to regressively predict the
                  ranking of a university based on its various funding and applicant statistics, as well as a linear regression model that predicted 
                  currency exchange rates based on the Big Mac Index. All of these projects were done using Python Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, as 
                  well as matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
